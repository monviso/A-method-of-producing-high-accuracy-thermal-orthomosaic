# Thermal-map-from-low-cost-UAV-camera

Ecological reserch can highly benefit from high resolution spatial temperature data to investigate localized processes driven by temperature.
You can find in the Wiki pages a full tutorial to priduce highly accurate thermal maps from inexpensive thermal sensor moun ted on UAV paltforms.

The tutorial has been developed using DJI Mavic Entrprise Dual palatfrom, with a specific focus on water and watered areas...

BUT, if you have any other sensor and struggling to implement your dadta with this procedure, just contact me. As well, if you are intersted in othert land coverage (grassland, soil, vegetations...) jsut get in touch to discuss any improvment to the procedures and specific models.
